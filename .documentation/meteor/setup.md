[Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
---

### OSX / Linux

Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest official Meteor release:

curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

For compatibility, Linux binaries are built with CentOS 6.4 i386/amd64.

iOS development requires the latest Xcode.

### Windows

First install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), then run this command using an Administrator command prompt:

choco install meteor

Meteor supports Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 R2 and up.

The installer uses Chocolatey, which has its own [requirements](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation#requirements).

Disabling antivirus (Windows Defender, etc.) will improve performance.

iOS development is not supported.
